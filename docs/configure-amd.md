- Download and extract the latest recommended driver from the [AMD drivers and support page](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

- Move ``Packages\Drivers\Display\XXXX_INF`` to the desktop. The folder may be named differently on other driver versions

- Open Device Manager and install the driver by right-clicking on the display adapter, then select ``Update driver`` and select the driver folder

- Extract ``XXXX_INF\ccc2_install.exe`` with 7-Zip and run ``CN\cnext\cnext64\ccc-next64.msi`` to install the Radeon software control panel

- Download [Autoruns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns) and navigate to the ``Everything`` section, then disable unnecessary AMD entries such as ``AMD Crash Defender``, ``AMD External Events Utility`` (required for VRR) and more. Ensure not to disable the core kernel-mode driver or other important components
